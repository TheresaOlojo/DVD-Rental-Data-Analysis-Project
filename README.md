# Overview

This project explores a DVD rental database using PostgreSQL to extract key business insights. The dataset includes rental transactions, customer details, store operations, and movie metadata. Through SQL queries, I analyzed rental trends, customer behavior, movie popularity, and store profitability.

## Objectives
- Identify rental patterns and high-performing movies.
- Evaluate customer activity and payment trends.
- Analyze store performance and inventory gaps.
- Provide data-driven insights for business optimization.

## Tools Used
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Query Language: SQL
- Data Visualization: PostgreSQL functions (e.g., GROUP BY, JOIN, COUNT, SUM)

## Key Analyses & SQL Queries
#### Customer Insights
- Find customers sharing the same address (e.g., households)
- Identify the customer with the highest total payments
- List customers who have not rented any movies so far
#### Movie Performance
- Identify the most rented movie
- Find movies that have been rented and those yet to be rented
- Show the number of times each movie has been rented
- Display all movies available for rent in both stores and those exclusive to one
- Identify PG-rated movies and their rental frequency
#### Actor Analysis
- List actors who have featured in more than 20 movies
- Show each actor and the number of movies they have acted in
#### Store Performance
- Determine rental counts by movie rating
- Display the most rented movie in store 1
- Show the number of movies not yet available for rent in both stores
- Compare the profit of store 1 vs store 2
## Business Insights
- Understanding rental demand helps optimize inventory and pricing strategies.
- Identifying high-value customers supports targeted marketing campaigns.
- Analyzing store profitability enables resource allocation for better revenue generation.
- Evaluating actor and genre popularity assists in making data-driven content acquisition decisions.

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in extracting actionable business intelligence from transactional data.
